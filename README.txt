TestTicketSystemDatabase.java

Note: All the files are completed, and follow the team proposal's schedule. I create two new classes to provide test methods for Front End Developer and Back End Developer. The methods in those two class test every single method been used in the back end and front end part of project

TestDatabase.java

Note: All the files follow the team proposal's schedule. For TestDatabase.java, I create a  class to provide test methods for Data wrangler. The methods in this new class test every single method been used in data organization of the project.

I finish organizing and combining the group project including change the tiny differences within the codes. For example, when one group member use removeTicket() rather than deleteTicket(), I change this kind of difference so that our project will run
